This is a collection of essays on the topic of our relationship to AI â€“ how we should approach it, and how we need to step up.</p>

I chose the form of essays not because this is not a coherent theory, 
but because when you try to map a threedimensional sphere onto a twodimensional plane, you'll have to distort you meaning locally. 
So I'll give you different aspects and you'll see what resonates with you.
