    This project aims at examining the requirements for a fertile co-existence 
    of humankind with AI, where the possible expressions of what it means to
    be human expand, not diminish. 
<p>
It is currently doing so via a collection of essays on the topic of our relationship to AI â€“ how we should approach it, and how we need to step up personally.</p>
<p>
I chose the form of essays not because this is not a coherent theory, 
but because it is multi-faceted with no one obvious entry point. I hope you will find an angle that resonates with you.
