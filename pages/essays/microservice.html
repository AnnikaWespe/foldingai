<p class="paragraph">
  Many people consider technical and social skills as two different realms — one
  for logic and precision, the other for empathy and communication. In truth,
  they are not opposites at all. Good software is nothing other than good
  communication, formalized: between a program and its user, between one module
  and another, and between one programmer and another — even across time.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  The same principles that make for a well-structured codebase also foster
  graceful collaboration and autonomous, well-functioning systems — whether
  those systems are made of silicon or of people.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Take, for instance, the open–closed principle in object-oriented programming.
  It states that a module should be <em>open for extension</em> but
  <em>closed for modification</em>: its behaviour can be extended without
  rewriting its inner workings. In software architecture, this idea evolved into
  microservices — instead of one monolithic block dictating everything, a
  constellation of small, self-contained services communicate through clearly
  defined interfaces, each with its own language, timing, and local logic.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  This maps beautifully onto systemic principles. A complex system — be it a
  team, an organisation, or a person — cannot be “fixed” by external
  intervention. Its logic emerged to meet its own challenges, and to truly
  understand or improve it, one would have to replicate it completely — which is
  impossible. The moment you start modifying its core from the outside, you
  break more than you build.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  The alternative is both humbler and more effective: communicate through the
  system’s own API. Don’t try to override someone’s internal code; send a
  request instead. Ask, listen, receive data. If it’s not working as expected,
  file a bug report: What did you do? What was your actual goal? What did you
  get instead? Be concrete — developers appreciate it when you attach a
  screenshot, that is, when you describe precisely what happened and what was
  said. Then, mind the environment — the context. Were there special
  circumstances that led to the unusual behaviour? Sometimes, a service is
  simply lacking resources to perform properly.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  And if you find yourself in a similar bind — the incoming request doesn’t
  match any of your endpoints, and your first instinct would be to return
  “Unknown error” — be kind and provide some context for the bug. At which point
  in the program did it fail exactly? What request did you receive, and what did
  you actually expect? Date formatting errors do have a way of creeping in, you
  know.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  So if you want better communication skills, model a microservice: be coherent,
  transparent, and extendable — but never lose the integrity of your own code.
  And be as patient and diligent with debugging hairy situations as you would be
  with your essential APIs.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">And one more thing:</p>

<p class="pull-quote">Keep your dependencies updated.</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  In some situations you may be using deprecated libraries, state of the art at
  the time, but in the meanwhile you've learned and grown and explored different
  ways of being, that might carry over to situations where you feel stuck in
  your ways. Check if there's a better way to do things now.
