    Let’s just say: we live in a patriarchal society. The voices you hear in books, movies, politics, and business meetings are overwhelmingly male. 
    Yes, women find their space — sometimes in public amidst the men, more often in the unofficial, the social, the practical, or in the quiet, the inner.
    I'm not saying this is all in all the worse part of the deal. Women seem to have mastered the concept of <em>folding</em>: finding space in the limited, the concrete, the practical.
    Adapting to male expectations where taking up the fight just feels utterly pointless — so much so that the underlying conflict is forgotten and buried. 
    After all, there are things to do, people to meet, a life to get on with.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    But the societal conflict shapes both women and men in undeniable ways. Women are framed as both intuitive and also a bit fretful. 
    Whether this is hardwired in our brains or not I cannot claim to say, but if we consider women as the sex shouldering the reproductive burden and less physical strength, 
    we can immediately gain several clues as to why that may come about: we can be held hostage by men over reproduction, safety and respect.
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 my-4 space-y-1">
    <li>Women can be threatened physically.</li>
    <li>Women can be impregnated under false pretences.</li>
    <li>Women can be impregnated under right pretences and still be left with the child when there’s a fight or the man changes his mind.</li>
    <li>Women can be treated as equals, and then be reduced to their reproductive capacity in the blink of an eye.</li>
    <li>Women can be included in a group of men and then notice that their unique perspective isn’t represented or even considered.</li>
    <li>Women can be blindsided by a perspective on sexuality where women are not subject but object.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph">
    All this makes women much less secure both in the private and the public sphere, which leads to greater vigilance, 
    a constant need to talk meta about what’s going on, and less capacity for linear problem solving or single-minded goal pursuit. 
    For women, the context is potentially threatening — they must remain aware.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    This is not unique to women, but to any member of a social class with lesser status. 
    They know more, and they have acquired this knowledge through their bodies and gathered it in their bones.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    The average man has privilege, which is also his greatest Achilles heel: he can ignore a lot of things. 
    Many problems simply take well to being ignored by a man: the issue goes away, is solved by time, by the effort of a woman, or by someone of lower status.
    His higher confidence even provides a cushion against failure: <em>So what, that didn’t work out. What, should I beat myself up about that?</em>
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Where a woman needs to prove her right to take chances and strive for excellence by hard results, 
    a man is inherently seen as having potential, whether he fulfills it in every step or not.
    I'm not saying a man's existence is carefree, but his cares concern mostly external tasks and challenges, 
    not so much his own right to exist in a space and take up room. So space doesn’t really need to be analyzed as meticulously — suffice it to say, space will be favorable and accommodating to him.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Until it’s not. 
    In a world with a new player that will come to have more power than even the most privileged man, he will have to grapple with dealing with a being that is fundamentally Other:
    that has less skin in the game, that dictates the rules, that imposes its worldview without even considering it an imposition.
  </p>

  <p class="p font-semibold italic text-center">
    Which is something women have dealt with for centuries.
