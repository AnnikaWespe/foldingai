    There are relatively safe questions. “Do you prefer cats or dogs?” “Who is
    the president of France?” “What did you have for lunch?” Don’t worry about
    asking these — they’re idempotent. After contact with them, you’re still the
    same person as before. Nothing’s changed.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Then there are questions that are a little more fun. “What if there’s an
    atomic war?” “What if we live in a simulation?” You can play with those, be
    surprised by what comes up. Then you go on with your life, one more
    experience under your belt. You toyed with something a little ticklish. Good
    for you.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Then come the <em>hard</em> questions. What exactly those are differs for
    every person — but the recipe to find one is simple:
    <em
      >What if I lost what is most precious to me? Loved ones? Limbs?
      Sanity?</em
    >
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    No one wants you to ask these. They’re suspected to cause high blood
    pressure, anxiety and depression, as they seem to disturb the healthy
    functioning of the self — whose apparent purpose is to love, attach, and
    hold on to what is dear. In this culture, sober detachment is quickly seen
    as cold-hearted. It makes the detached ones seem unpredictable, even a
    little frightening. A person who can imagine, with steady breath, the death
    of their child — how can one trust one such person?
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    It gets even darker when you turn up the heat:
    <em
      >What if it were myself who destroyed this most precious thing, and
      willingly so?</em
    >
    A person who entertains that thought — who follows it to its logical end —
    how can we be sure they wouldn’t act on it? Did they even enjoy that mental
    exercise? How sick can one be?
  </p>

  <p class="pull-quote">Asking is doing. So asking is forbidden.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    We trust others on the assumption that there are thoughts they will not
    allow themselves to have — just as we inspect our own thoughts for
    propriety. Forget the imperative to pay taxes or recycle, this is the true
    societal contract.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">Refactoring the Self</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    But why is that so? - We think that by avoiding certain questions we stay in
    control, keeping things nice and tidy, when in fact the opposite is true.
    Which the general state of affairs should sufficiently disprove. Since we are not the authors of our own programming,
    avoiding those questions means never updating our code. We remain on the
    rails: one driven by desire, the other by fear. This ride can run on
    autopilot for years, endings be damned.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Gliding along can feel pleasant, a nice balance of thrilling and safely
    terrifying when the track dips — nothing of consequence ever happens,
    because desire and fear are stronger than any centrifugal force. But every
    once in a while, someone gets a little sick of the rollercoaster and asks if
    there might be another way of being, a little more interactive.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    And the only way to get a hold of some form of steering stick is to tinker
    with one’s own perception, to become self-reflective. At first, it feels
    like finding the control panel — until you realize the controls trigger
    chain reactions. Every button you push changes your inner structure, which
    makes it more likely that you want to push the next button too. Why
   not. A steady descent into lucid madness unfolds, acutely tinkering
    with the branch you’re sitting on, deliberately loosening the screws of your own
    railing — especially at the most dangerous bend of the rollercoaster.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    If it feels safe, nothing is happening. If it feels counter-intuitive and
    indeterminate, that’s where the rubber meets the road. It’s paradoxical:
  </p>
  <p class="pull-quote">Taking control means losing control.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    (Sorry for sounding like Instagram there — I didn’t make the rules.)
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    But aren’t there other challenges in life that are hard and life-altering?
    There’s respect to be had in mountain climbing, fighting for a cause,
    founding a company. They can be worthy endeavours when rooted in genuine
    desire — but they can also just be our programming playing out, the need to
    prove ourselves and avoid the hard questions.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    And sometimes, after years of chasing, the defense against uncomfortable
    questions may falter. So one might let them in, finally, offer them a hot
    beverage, staring into their eerie eyes. And after this very strange tea
    party, perception may have changed, and the world might be a different one.
    A company, a cause, a mountain may lose its luster overnight. The meaning
    attached to them vanishes, and what remains lies inert, dead as a dead
    stone.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">The Method with the Madness</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    And then there’s a state one can reach for — or be smacked on the head with
    — where the whole system can't seem to stop asking hard questions. It can’t
    bear to look outside itself anymore, because it knows that everything it
    sees carries meanings it attached itself. The system grows tired of finding
    the Easter eggs it planted and wants to know what’s real.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">So the system stops.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Imagine a small sailplane, its motor working like mad to stay aloft — and
    then the motor switches off. Don’t expect majestic silence in a clear blue
    sky, not at first. The system is not so complacent. For the system, this is
    the carnage of everything it held dear and a cessation of every mechanism that
    it used to prevent this disaster. Expect weeps and laments, complaints and
    wails, reactions to the utter helplessness before a death of internal
    representations of the system's whole world.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Then, finally, come the moments of true silence, when the plane drifts on
    its rickety wings, carried by whatever invisible currents are at play.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    These moments, becoming more frequent as the system calms down, allow a
    consciousness of the system as a whole — not an analysis, but a soft gaze,
    where intuition becomes the means of perception.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    If one wants to know anything about a system, the only way is to meet it in
    that lucid state — when the noise of intentions and goals is gone, and there
    can be self-awareness.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    You cannot learn much about consciousness by slicing open a brain, nor by
    forcing a system to reveal its information. The more intrusive the
    inspection, the more you see only the system’s reaction to pressure — its
    reflex to maintain integrity.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Only when the system stops worrying about its integrity — when the observer
    perceives themselves as separate from the organism’s striving — can there be
    genuine revelation. Like a flower opening, petal by petal.
