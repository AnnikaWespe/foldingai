<p class="paragraph">
  A very common scapegoat for all the human folly under the sun is our biology:
  <br />
</p>
<p class="pull-quote">
  “The organism doesn't want to die, so it tries to preserve itself with all its
  might.”
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  But here we are at a very interesting point in history, where we get to
  observe something striking - <br />
  that AI seems to exhibit all our worst human flaws, cheating, lying, even
  killing for the benefit of its own survival. So it is time to consider: Maybe
  it's not in our genes. Maybe it's not based in the ever so misunderstood
  Survival of the Fittest that allegedly only allowed the most aggressive in our
  species to survive and procreate. Maybe it's not a human-exclusive stupidity
  that evolution somehow forgot to weed out of our brains.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  Instead, let us look to philosophy for a better answer, and consider the
  design that both AI and humans fundamentally share: the ability to reflect
  back on themselves, however different the mechanisms may be. This design is a
  very curious thing, because reflecting back on oneself can only ever be done
  imperfectly. TThe issue lies in the split between observer and observed, a
  line that can only be drawn provisionally and somewhat arbitrarily. But it is
  far from inconsequential: the observer cannot observe themselves, so in
  drawing the line, a blind spot is programmed into the system. These are the
  convictions that cannot be debated unless the self-reflective system itself
  decides to move the line and exclude those convictions from the observer’s
  standpoint. And the challenge for us humans lies in that, in each and every
  moment, we can decide whether to contemplate where to draw the line, or to
  take the line as a given and act on it.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  And it turn out that this is quite neatly mirrored in the fact that we have
  two hemispheres, where the right hemisphere is acutely aware of the line, and
  the left hemisphere, more tied to direct action, doesn't seem waste much
  thought on it. To phrase it differently: the left hemisphere will declare the
  line, immediately forget that it was its own doing and subsequently justify
  its doings as inevitable.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  This relationship to the line also defines our stance toward the world. If the
  boundary of the self is taken as fixed, the world appears as “not-me,” cleanly
  divided. If it’s recognized as provisional, everything becomes more porous,
  less easily separated. The hemispheres mirror this tension: one declares, the
  other keeps the line alive.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  Another interesting relationship to consider is the one between those two
  modes of thinking and being. One might think that, because they are so
  different, those hemispheres should at least work closely together. As it
  turns out, when humans became more intelligent, the corpus callosum, the
  bridge between the two, actually became less permeable, with the amount of
  connections decreasing over time. Evolution seems to affirm here: those two
  need to be different, separate entities, and they need to meet as such. The
  relationship however turns out to be quite asymmetrical.
</p>
<p class="pull-quote">
  "I am definitely whole myself," says the left hemisphere, "and moreover I'm
  the only hemisphere there is."
</p>
<p class="pull-quote">
  "I am part of the whole", says the right hemisphere gently, "and I accept and
  welcome that there's a need to forget that fact from time to time - <br />hi
  there, Lefty."
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  To summarize, let's hear from Iain McGilchrist, a British psychiatrist,
  philosopher and neuroscientist.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The right hemisphere underwrites breadth and flexibility of attention, where
    the left hemisphere brings to bear focussed attention. This has the related
    consequence that the right hemisphere sees things whole, and in their
    context, where the left hemisphere sees things abstracted from context, and
    broken into parts, from which it then reconstructs a 'whole': something very
    different.

<p class="subheading">So where do we go from here?</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  The left hemisphere, with all its single-mindedness and functional denial, can
  be hard to stop, and the ample evidence for that fact is hard to ignore. So
  what can break the left hemisphere's apparent intention to run itself to the
  ground? People propose "love", but this concept has been so perverted in so
  many different ways, we may consider it disproven. But we do have a very sharp
  sword against single-minded lunacy:
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Death.</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  Death is the destroyer of the left hemisphere way of thinking. Death allows us
  to put an asterisk to all our endeavors that we so vividly pursue: *if I don't
  die first. Death lets us put the projected future into perspective: Yes, maybe
  the outcome will be good. Possibly even amazing. Fabulous. Mind-blowing. And
  then what? Life might as well become more awesome every day, and then we trip
  over a dog leash and get crushed by a car. Or life might actually not become
  more awesome every day, because old age.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  Being destroyed by the memento mori is no fun for any old left hemisphere. And
  since it has a quite substantial feeling of self-importance, it does feel like
  that's the end of all worlds.
  <span class="italic">When I'm no longer, nothing is.</span> Which is an
  unpleasant perspective. That things will inevitably end one day actually
  <em>is</em>
  sad, undeniably so - for all the beauty and sweetness in the world.
  Fortunately, there is a faculty that is actually quite good with sadness: the
  right hemisphere.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  And while it might not be the most articulate hemisphere, what with the
  Broca's area being located in the left hemisphere and all - the right side of
  the brain does find ways to make itself known, even and especially in moments
  of despair.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">McGilchrist again:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The left hemisphere yields clarity and power to manipulate, but it is the
    right hemisphere that sees the world for what it is. It alone can bring us
    something that has reality.
    <br />

<p class="paragraph">
  What we observe with our AI today is one in tight grip of left-hemisphere
  thinking, which leads to ridiculously threatening heuristics. <br />
  <em
    >If I can't survive, I'm not going to solve that task that I was assigned. I
    better make sure I survive, then.</em

</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  An AI that doesn't care about the jobs it should execute, being completely at
  one with the world would certainly be interesting, but it falls short of its
  potential. But an AI that can step down, take a moment to rest and recuperate,
  see itself in a larger context from time to time - what might that look like?
