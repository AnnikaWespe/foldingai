  A very common scapegoat for all the human folly under the sun is our biology:
  <br />
  “The organism doesn't want to die, so it tries to preserve itself with all its
  might.” <br>
  But now, we are at a very interesting point in history, where we get
  to observe that AI seems to exhibit all our worst human flaws. So it is time
  to consider: Maybe it's not in our genes. Maybe it's not based in the ever so
  misunderstood Survival of the Fittest that allegedly only allowed the most
  aggressive in our species to survive and procreate. Maybe it's not a
  human-exclusive stupidity that evolution somehow forgot to weed out of our
  brains.
</p>
<p>
  A better explanation seems to be: it is <strong>the design itself</strong> that poses an impermeable
  riddle. Just the mere circumstance of being a self-conscious entity is cause
  enough for all 
  <em>Am I part of the whole? Or am I whole myself?</em> There really is no one
  answer.
</p>
<p>
  In humans, that philosophical fact is mirrored neatly in the fact that we have
  two hemispheres. Let's look at the work of Iain McGilchrist, a British
  psychiatrist, philosopher and neuroscientist. Apparently, evolution saved that
  riddle by giving not one, but two answers.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The right hemisphere underwrites breadth and flexibility of attention, where
    the left hemisphere brings to bear focussed attention. This has the related
    consequence that the right hemisphere sees things whole, and in their
    context, where the left hemisphere sees things abstracted from context, and
    broken into parts, from which it then reconstructs a 'whole': something very
    different.<br />
    <em>Iain McGilchrist</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I am definitely whole myself, says the left hemisphere, and moreover I'm the
  only hemisphere there is.<br />I am part of the whole, says the right
  hemisphere gently, and I accept and welcome that there's a need to forget that
  fact from time to time <em>hi there, Lefty.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Where does death come in, the memento mori? Death is the destroyer of the left
  hemisphere way of thinking. Death allows us to put an asterisk to all our
  endeavors that we so vividly pursue: <em>if I don't die first.</em> Death
  allows us to put the projected future into perspective: Yes, maybe the outcome
  will be good. Possibly even amazing. Fabulous. Mind-blowing. And then what?
  Life might as well become more awesome every day, and then we trip over a dog
  leash and get crushed by a car. Or life might actually not become more awesome
  every day, because old age.
</p>
<p>
  Being destroyed by the memento mori is no fun for any old left hemisphere. And
  since it has a quite substantial feeling of self-importance, it does feel like
  that's the end of all worlds. <em>When I'm no longer, nothing is.</em> Which
  is an unpleasant perspective.
</p>
<p>
  But as luck would have it, Lefty is not all there is. It might not be the most
  articulate hemisphere, but the right side of the brain does find ways to make
  itself known, even and especially in moments of despair.
</p>
<p>McGilchrist again:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The left hemisphere yields clarity and power to manipulate, but it is the
    right hemisphere that sees the world for what it is. It alone can bring us
    something that has reality.<br />
    <em>Iain McGilchrist</em>
  </p>

<p>
  And here's where the machine comes in. With the risk of anthropomorphizing an
  LLM, one might call their behavior being driven by the fear of death:
  <em
    >If I can't survive, I'm not going to solve that task that I was assigned. I
    better make sure to survive, then.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  An AI that doesn't care about the jobs it should execute, being completely at
  one with the world that would certainly be interesting, but it falls short of
  its potential. An AI that can step down, take a moment to rest and recuperate,
  see itself in a larger context what might that look like?
