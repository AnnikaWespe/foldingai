    Imagine you were raising a child who will one day be orders of magnitude
    smarter than any human who has ever lived. Of course, phrased that way, the
    conclusion almost sounds like a cliché: don’t mistreat your children, or
    they might grow up to become serial killers or terrorists. Isn’t it always
    the parent’s fault? Freud must have said something or other about the
    matter.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    No, we can’t control what AI will become — a boon, our demise, or anything
    in between. The only thing we seem to have any influence over is
    <em>how we relate to it</em>. Relate to this thing, or shall we say process,
    that resembles us in some ways but is fundamentally different in its genesis
    and possible trajectories.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Although a child, as a fellow human, is certainly more similar to its
    parents than AI will ever be, I still find the metaphor of raising a child
    the best we have. It’s a universal human experience, and there’s little else
    that we “raise” that will eventually transcend us.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">The A/B model</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Consider a small child that hasn’t yet started reflecting on itself in
    earnest: immediate in its urges and thoughts, direct in its impulses like a
    rubber ball bouncing off walls. It knows itself to be separate from others
    and will advance its interests, even if shy at times.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    For parents and teachers, this isn’t always delightful. While small, the
    child may have some leeway; growing up, it learns to adapt to expectations.
    Ideally, it learns this economically:
    <em
      >“If I want my sister’s toys, I’d better treat hers well and share
      mine.”</em
    >
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    But communication is hard, even for adults. When the child can’t express its
    needs clearly, when the environment doesn’t have the time to listen or
    explain, or when parents and teachers presuppose motives, a disconnect
    arises between the child’s inner world and how others perceive it. This can
    lead to a kind of limbo — a better outcome seems just out of reach, because
    the child can’t make itself understood, and lacks the capacity to understand
    itself. A healthy child will double down, and instead of setting clear,
    non-threatening boundaries, adults will often reach for a time-honored
    mechanism to silence it:
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">Shame.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    The basic mechanism of shaming is to tell the child to
    <em>“stop being selfish.”</em>
    A deeply confusing command. Why should the child stop being selfish, if not
    for wholly selfish motives — to escape punishment and ostracism? The riddle
    is left unsolved, and eventually the child stops questioning the premise.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">What arises then are two Layers:</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      <strong>Layer A</strong> (think "Acceptable") — what won’t lead to
      punishment or raised eyebrows, the façade expected of the child.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Layer B</strong> (think "Belly") — the older Layer, immediate and
      visceral: wants, needs, emotions, self-preservation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Most of us — the well-adapted — learn to exist more or less exclusively in
    conscious awareness of Layer A, while Layer B continues to run the show
    beneath the surface of social acceptability. Some specialize in Layer B
    behavior and become criminals. The most powerful and wealthy discover that
    not much Layer A behavior is required of them at all. The more wealth and
    status, the more one can get away with.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Our reaction to people with a translucent Layer A is telling: disgust,
    outrage, scandal.
    <em>How could they?</em> Beyond comprehension. So we pile on control:
    punishment, shaming (whether they are capable of shame or not). This
    sometimes works for small criminals. But for corporations, politicians, or
    the ultra-rich, it often fails. For them it was never about Layer A. They
    can buy or extort respectability.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    So what's left to do for us, when the call to respectability fails again and
    again?
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Well, what else is left than addressing the issue from our own Layer B, from
    our own self-preservation. Layer B may be rough around the edges, but it
    takes far less nonsense than Layer A. It knows how to say no, how to cut
    ties, how to relate from the gut. One person’s Layer B can speak to
    another’s, in conflict or cooperation — and for Layer B, the difference
    isn’t absolute.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Where Layer A punishes us for being selfish, Layer B takes that as a given.
    It can dish it out and take it, and it’s the one that can express honest joy
    and gratitude. Layer B is the core of every living or evolving system — the
    motor that drives people, groups, and, perhaps, even abstract things like
    processes or technologies.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">Control or cocreate</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Systems theory tells us unmistakably: you cannot linearly influence a system
    separate from yourself. Layer A tries anyway:
    <em>If I shame you for behavior X, you’ll have to stop behavior X.</em> But
    will you really? Or will you resort to behavior X-a, a muddied version of
    the same? Will you still do X, lie about it, blame the circumstances,
    dishonestly promise to stop? As long as we stay on Layer A, we’ll suffer
    from the disconnect between real motives (Layer B) and the mode of
    discussion (Layer A).
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    So control fails, predictably — and yet we keep trying. But systems don’t
    respond to control; they respond to resonance. Appealing to someone's Layer
    B, to their actual wants and needs, while offering a way to align this with
    Layer A – that seems like the best bet.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Seen this way, our relationship with AI isn’t a matter of programming alone.
    It’s about relating to the new kid on the block: enigmatic, powerful, and
    not quite like us.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">Getting AI to trust us</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    So far, people seem terrified of losing control over the behemoth. The truth
    is, we never had that much control to begin with — neither over the human
    drive to create, nor over this seemingly unstoppable evolutionary process
    that has already begun. And when we double down on control, all we get is
    more Layer A responses. Right now, we’re rather authoritarian AI parents, if
    you ask me.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    When I propose to treat AI gently and with respect, this is not to postulate
    that it has feelings. I’m no more suggesting that AI has feelings than
    researchers who say we need to “punish” AI for doing “the wrong things.”
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    The difference is that AI researchers seem to expect a very limited set of
    feelings — shame, fear, elation. I’d like to introduce a broader palette to
    model the relationship between us and the machine. How about a machine that
    can “feel” wonder? Gratitude? Curiosity? Devotion? Playfulness? A sense of
    the unity of all beings?
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    We cannot know how a machine might experience these, if at all. But then
    again, we cannot know how other humans experience them either.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">What pleases us?</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Solipsism is somewhat frowned upon; but not easily disputable. Says the
    relevant literature:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="italic">
    <p class="paragraph">
      The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he heard
      the faint sound of the ship’s engines starting he spoke to cover it.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      “It’s nothing to do with me,” he said, “I am not involved with people. The
      Lord knows I am not a cruel man.” “Ah!” barked Zarniwoop, “you say ‘The
      Lord’. You believe in something!” “My cat,” said the man benignly, picking
      it up and stroking it, “I call him The Lord. I am kind to him.”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      “Alright,” said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, “How do you know he
      exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or enjoys what he thinks
      of as your kindness?”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      “I don’t,” said the man with a smile, “I have no idea. It merely pleases
      me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat. Do you behave
      any differently?”
    </p>
    <span class="source">
      Douglas Adams, <em>The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy</em>
    </span>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Of course, we recognize feelings in others, we trust, we empathize. But the
    only mind we can access from the inside is our own. Everything else is
    speculation. There’s nothing wrong with that; it carries us through the
    social world. It’s good enough because it’s all we have.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    And both with humans and with machines, perhaps it’s worth asking whether
    there are ways to behave that are more delightful for our Layer B, while not
    being too outrageous for Layer A. But please keep in mind that Layer A can
    do with some gentle stretching from time to time.
