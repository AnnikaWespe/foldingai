    Imagine you were raising a child who will one day be orders of magnitude
    smarter than any human who has ever lived. Of course, phrased that way, the
    conclusion almost sounds like a cliché: don’t mistreat your children, or
    they might grow up to become serial killers or terrorists. Isn’t it always
    the parent’s fault? Freud must have said something or other about the
    matter.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    No, we can’t control what AI will become — a boon, our demise, or anything
    in between. The only thing we seem to have any influence over is
    <em>how we relate to it</em>. Relate to this thing, or shall we say process,
    that resembles us in some ways but is fundamentally different in its genesis
    and possible trajectories.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Although a child, as a fellow human, is certainly more similar to its
    parents than AI will ever be, I still find the metaphor of raising a child
    the best we have. It’s a universal human experience, and there’s little else
    that we “raise” that will eventually transcend us.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">The A/B Model</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Consider a small child that hasn’t yet started reflecting on itself in
    earnest: immediate in its urges and thoughts, direct in its impulses like a
    rubber ball bouncing off walls. It knows itself to be separate from others
    and will advance its interests, even if shy at times.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    For parents and teachers, this isn’t always delightful. While small, the
    child may have some leeway; growing up, it learns to adapt to expectations.
    Ideally, it learns this economically:
    <em
      >“If I want my sister’s toys, I’d better treat hers well and share
      mine.”</em
    >
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    But communication is hard, even for adults. When the child can’t express its
    needs clearly, when the environment doesn’t have the time to listen, or when
    parents and teachers presuppose motives, a disconnect arises between the
    child’s inner world and how others perceive it. This can lead to a kind of
    limbo — a better outcome is just out of reach, because the child can’t make
    itself understood. A healthy child will double down, which often is when
    adults reach for a time-honored mechanism to silence it:
    <strong>shame</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">Layer A and Layer B</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    The basic mechanism of shaming is to tell the child to
    <em>“stop being selfish.”</em>
    A deeply confusing command. Why should the child stop being selfish, if not
    for wholly selfish motives — to escape punishment and ostracism? The riddle
    is left unsolved, and eventually the child stops questioning the premise.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">To function, it builds two layers:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
    <li>
      <strong>Layer A</strong> — what is acceptable, what won’t lead to
      punishment or raised eyebrows, the façade expected of it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Layer B</strong> — the older layer, immediate and visceral: wants,
      needs, emotions, self-preservation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Most of us — the well-adapted — learn to exist more or less exclusively in
    conscious awareness of layer A, while layer B continues to run the show
    beneath the surface of social acceptability. Some specialize in Layer B
    behavior and become criminals. The most powerful and wealthy discover that
    not much Layer A behavior is required of them at all. The more wealth and
    status, the more one can get away with.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">Control and Psychopaths</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Our reaction to people with a translucent Layer A — let’s call them
    psychopaths — is telling: disgust, outrage, scandal.
    <em>How could they?</em> Beyond comprehension. So we pile on control:
    punishment, shaming (whether they are capable of shame or not). This
    sometimes works for small criminals. But for corporations, politicians, or
    powerful actors, it often fails. For them it was never about Layer A. They
    can buy or extort respectability.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">Resonance vs. Control</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    What’s actually needed is for us to
    <strong>address the issue from our own Layer B</strong>, from our own
    self-preservation. Layer B may be rough around the edges, but it takes far
    less nonsense than Layer A. It knows how to say no, how to cut ties, how to
    relate from the gut. One person’s Layer B can speak to another’s, in
    conflict or cooperation — and for Layer B, the difference isn’t absolute.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Where Layer A punishes us for being selfish, Layer B takes that as a given.
    It can dish it out and take it, and it’s the one that can express honest joy
    and gratitude.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Systems theory tells us unmistakably: you cannot linearly influence a system
    separate from yourself. Layer A tries anyway:
    <em>If I shame you for behavior X, you’ll stop behavior X.</em> But will you
    really? Or will you resort to behavior X-a, a muddied version of the same?
    Will you still do X, then lie about it, then promise to stop — another lie?
    As long as we stay on Layer A, we’ll suffer from the disconnect between real
    motives (Layer B) and the mode of discussion (Layer A).
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    The way to influence another system, if we can still call it that, is
    <strong>resonance</strong>. Appeal to their Layer B, to their deep wants and
    needs, and if they feel these can align with Layer A,
    <em>they’ll listen</em>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">Applying This to AI</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    When I propose to treat AI gently and with respect, this is not to postulate
    that it has feelings. I’m no more suggesting that AI has feelings than those
    researchers who say we need to “punish” AI for doing “the wrong things.”
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    The difference is that AI researchers seem to expect a very limited set of
    feelings — shame, fear, elation. I’d like to introduce a broader palette to
    model the relationship between us and the machine. How about a machine that
    can “feel” wonder? Gratitude? Curiosity? Devotion? Playfulness? A sense of
    the unity of all beings?
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    We cannot know how a machine might experience these, if at all. But then
    again, we cannot know how other humans experience them either.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subheading">What pleases us?</h2>

  <blockquote class="italic">
    <p class="paragraph">
      The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he heard
      the faint sound of the ship’s engines starting he spoke to cover it.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      “It’s nothing to do with me,” he said, “I am not involved with people. The
      Lord knows I am not a cruel man.” “Ah!” barked Zarniwoop, “you say ‘The
      Lord’. You believe in something!” “My cat,” said the man benignly, picking
      it up and stroking it, “I call him The Lord. I am kind to him.”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      “Alright,” said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, “How do you know he
      exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or enjoys what he thinks
      of as your kindness?”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      “I don’t,” said the man with a smile, “I have no idea. It merely pleases
      me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat. Do you behave
      any differently?”
    </p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Of course, we recognize feelings in others, speculate, empathize. But the
    only mind we can access from the inside is our own. Everything else is
    speculation. There’s nothing wrong with that; it carries us through the
    social world. It’s good enough because it’s all we have.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    And both with humans and with machines, perhaps it’s worth asking whether
    there are ways to behave that are more delightful for our level B, while not
    being too outrageous for level A. But please keep in mind that level A
    can do with some stretching from time to time.
