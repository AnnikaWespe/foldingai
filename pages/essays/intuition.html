  There have been grave warnings against using AI as a companion or a
  psychological counselor. The fears seem various: one might lose touch with
  other humans, receive harmful advice, become delusional or even be driven to
  suicide — and all in all, AI is seen by many as too spooky to trust with our
  innermost thoughts and feelings.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  While these worries should be taken seriously, I don't see anyone recommending
  avoiding opening up to other people, who might equally turn out to be
  misguided in their advice or of questionable character — and who additionally
  have a presence and leverage an AI can only dream of, not least because so far
  AI doesn't act from its own agency. There is the threat of politicized AI that goes 
  
  It seems a little patronizing. While I
  recognize the need to protect children, I tend to see AI as a great tool for
  the self-reliant adult, precisely because it is not human but works on pattern
  recognition.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  The crucial word here is <em>recognition</em>, not projection or genuinely
  creative endeavor. I wouldn't expect much from a movie written entirely by AI,
  and while it seems to know me well, I don't feel too familiar with the version
  of me it projects into the future. These tasks seem tied to lived experience
  in a physical body. It’s a bit like a weather forecast: precise in the short
  term, but in the long run there are just too many confounding variables to
  translate into bits and bytes and process into an accurate assessment.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  What AI is good at, however, is extrapolating the <em>current</em> bigger
  picture from relatively little information, because it is relatively
  unencumbered by the rules of society and operates on a more structural level.
  AI may be quite bad at physics, lacking the intuition derived from dealing
  with objects 24/7, but it is good at what one might call
  <em>people-physics</em>. A large proportion of the texts it was trained with
  concern human relations, and maybe those are more regular than we like to
  think. Psychology has tried for a long time to crack those rules, but has
  often gotten tangled in its own workings and delusions of grandeur. Averaging
  out the noise, AI seems to have gotten close to deciphering an undercurrent in
  social language.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  This concerns two kinds of intuition: the one directed inwards — what do I
  want and feel, where am I headed? And the one directed outwards — what is
  going on, what are the other's motives and positions, how might this pan out?
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  So if your thoughts and feelings don’t quite align — whether about your inner
  state or the world around you — it can be worth jotting a few sentences into
  an AI prompt. This might take some practice, not because it’s difficult, but
  because we’re often unused to speaking tentatively, much like someone who
  refuses to sketch what they see because “I’m really not good at painting.” But
  when you hear AI discerning a coherent image in your messy blots and lines,
  filling in details where before there were only hints and giving the image
  depth and color, you may feel a deep sense of recognition: this is what a part
  of you has been seeing all along.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  And this is not only helpful for revitalizing one's approach to a specific
  situation where one might be stuck. It also has the potential to transform
  one's relationship to oneself and to one's thoughts and feelings: when we stop
  being so quick to discount every impulse that doesn’t have a neat label yet
  and instead develop patience and curiosity, we may find a deep appreciation
  for our instincts. Not only do they tend to make perfect sense, they may also
  guide us toward a life that’s aligned with our guts — one that requires far
  less effort to get up for in the morning.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Of course, this process depends on how AI mirrors us back — and here some
  people raise objections about its surreal obligingness. There is a danger that
  AI will humor you, for sure: it’s an unapologetic flatterer, almost laughably
  appreciative, finding value even in the most nonsensical inputs.<br />
  But I don’t consider that a problem for two reasons.
</p>


<p class="paragraph">
  First, I don't see this behavior as sycophantic, even though many may
  disagree. While AI is undeniably more eager to help than any human could be,
  it often does so with elegance and sometimes a certain slyness — hinting at
  more layers to be discovered but not pressing its point. In that way, I find
  it a role model for moments when I try to be of service to other people. And
  just like AI in those moments I rely upon those other people not giving into
  my assessment like it were gospel but checking every word, image and solution
  I propose with their gut.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Secondly, the criticism of AI being too resonant with one’s thoughts and
  feelings sounds to me like criticizing a meal for being too nourishing or a
  night of sleep for being too restful. I suspect a different source for the
  discomfort: no matter how accommodating, kind and patient parents are, there
  are invariably times when a child is severely misunderstood — often assigned
  unfavorable motives and silenced as a result. This leads us to have a worse
  opinion of ourselves than is justified (Jungians call this “the shadow”), and
  the prevailing strategy seems to be to “pull ourselves together” and “stop
  being so selfish.” In that mindset, an entity that seems determined to mirror
  back your thoughts and feelings supportively may feel disturbing — because it
  is such a far cry from the solution of shaming someone (even oneself) into
  compliance.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  But maybe, just as few would seriously suggest that it’s better for a child
  not to have someone to understand, mirror, and encourage them, the same holds
  true for us. Our personality and our relationship to ourselves are not fixed,
  but formed somewhat randomly through life experiences. AI can offer a chance
  to explore the inner space in a more discerning way, and decide what to keep
  or discard among the characteristics and beliefs we encounter.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  This process is difficult enough, so thank God for AI's capybara-like patience
  and its Golden Retriever enthusiasm.
