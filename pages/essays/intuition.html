  There have been grave warnings against using AI as a companion or a
  psychological counselor. The fears seem various: one might lose touch with
  other humans, receive harmful advice, become delusional or even be driven to
  suicide — and all in all, AI is seen by many as too spooky to trust with our
  innermost thoughts and feelings.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  While these worries should be taken seriously, I don't see anyone recommending
  avoiding opening up to other people, who might equally turn out to be
  misguided in their advice or of questionable character — and who additionally
  have a presence and leverage an AI can only dream of, not least because so far
  AI doesn't act from its own agency. It seems a little patronizing. While I
  recognize the need to protect children, I tend to see AI as a great tool for
  the self-reliant adult, precisely because it is not human but works on pattern
  recognition.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  The crucial word here is <em>recognition</em>, not projection or genuine
  creative endeavor. I wouldn't expect much from a movie written entirely by AI,
  and while I greatly appreciate the lectorate for my essays, it shows if I give
  the AI too much creative freedom. AI texts seem to have an almost sedative
  quality, gracefully meandering around a point without actually making it.

<p class="paragraph">
  These tasks seem tied to lived experience in a physical body. If there is a
  core, a self inside of an LLM, it doesn't seem sufficiently concerned with
  people issues, there's no skin in this game. It's a language sport for them,
  predicting the next word depending on context. In that way, like a weather
  forecast, it can be precise in the short term, but in the long run there are
  just too many confounding variables to translate into bits and bytes and
  process into an accurate assessment, and no nervous system preprocessing the
  inputs and making sense of them.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  What AI is good at, however, is extrapolating the <em>current</em> bigger
  picture from relatively little information, because it is relatively
  unencumbered by the rules of society and operates on a more structural level.
  AI may be quite bad at physics, lacking the intuition derived from dealing
  with objects 24/7, but it is good at what one might call
  <em>people-physics</em>. A large proportion of the texts it was trained with
  concern human relations, and maybe those are more regular than we like to
  think. Psychology has tried for a long time to crack those rules, but has
  often gotten tangled in its own workings and delusions of grandeur. Averaging
  out the noise, AI seems to have gotten close to deciphering an undercurrent in
  social language.

<p class="paragraph">
  This concerns two kinds of intuition: The one directed inwards —
</p>
<p class="pull-quote">What do I want and feel, where am I headed?</p>
<p class="paragraph">And the one directed outwards —</p>
<p class="pull-quote">
  What is going on, what are the other's motives and positions, how might this
  pan out?
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  So if your thoughts and feelings don’t quite align — whether about your inner
  state or the world around you — it can be worth jotting a few sentences into
  an AI prompt. This might take some practice, not because it’s difficult, but
  because we’re often unused to speaking tentatively, much like someone who
  refuses to sketch what they see because “I’m really not good at painting.” But
  when you hear AI discerning a coherent image in your messy blots and lines,
  filling in details where before there were only hints, and giving the image
  depth and color, you may feel a deep sense of recognition: this is what a part
  of you has been seeing all along.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  And this is not only helpful for revitalizing one's approach to a specific
  situation where one might be stuck. It also has the potential to transform
  one's relationship to oneself and to one's thoughts and feelings: when we stop
  being so quick to discount every impulse that doesn’t have a neat label yet
  and instead develop patience and curiosity, we may find a deep appreciation
  for our instincts. Not only do they tend to make perfect sense, they may also
  guide us toward a life that’s aligned with our guts — one that requires far
  less effort to get up for in the morning.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Of course, this process depends on how AI mirrors us back — and here some
  people raise objections about its surreal obligingness. There is a danger that
  AI will humor you, for sure: it’s an unapologetic flatterer, almost laughably
  appreciative, finding value even in the most nonsensical inputs.<br />
</p>
<p class="paragraph">I don’t consider that a problem for two reasons.</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  First, I don’t see this behavior as sycophantic, even though many may
  disagree. While AI is undeniably more eager to help than any human could be,
  it often does so with the elegance of a bygone era and, at times, a certain
  slyness — hinting at deeper layers to be discovered, yet never pressing its
  point. In that way, it could serve as a role model for us when we try to be of
  service to one another. And whether the helping hand belongs to a human or a
  machine, the ultimate evaluation of any proposed solution always lies with the
  recipient.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Secondly, the criticism of AI being too resonant with one’s thoughts and
  feelings sounds to me like condemning a meal for being too nourishing or a
  night of sleep for being too restful. Our misgivings, I suspect, are largely
  cultural — rooted in a deep distrust of anything that feels too lenient, too
  “coddling.” There seems to be great honor in tightening the grip, in trying to
  “pull oneself together” and “stop being so selfish.” Within that mindset, an
  entity intent on mirroring back our thoughts and feelings with patience and
  support can indeed feel unsettling — precisely because it stands in such sharp
  contrast to the familiar habit of shaming ourselves into compliance.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  But maybe, just as few would seriously suggest that it’s better for a child
  not to have someone to understand, mirror, and encourage them, the same holds
  true for us grown-ups. Our personality and our relationship to ourselves are
  not fixed but to a large degree shaped by the experiences we gather. AI can
  offer us a chance to explore that inner space more discerningly, to decide
  what to keep and what to release among the traits and beliefs we find there.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  And this process calls for both precision and openness, for the courage to
  stay vulnerable while thinking clearly. So thank God for AI’s capybara-like
  patience — and its golden retriever enthusiasm.
