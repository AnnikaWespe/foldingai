  I had always thought that I could either reach financial stability, or lead my
  life with the amount of time free from depersonalized labour that I seemed to
  need to maintain my mental and physical health.
</p>

<p class="mb-5">
  In late summer 2021, I seemed to have managed exactly that; after working
  several years as a software dev freelancer in a money-flushed economy, I had
  saved up an amount of wealth that was baffling to me, and as a
  beneficiary of business politics had not had to work all that hard for it.
  Quite the contrary, I had had the opportunity for very long walks to regroup
  and stabilize myself after what felt like a life of emotional and financial
  volatility.
</p>
<p>
  So when the project finally ended, I found myself at the end of a rope; what I
  had not dared to wish for for several decades had come to pass, it seemed like
  I had nothing more to wish for in all important areas of my life. And there
  were literally no further endeavours that seemed worth pursuing, that would
  have come from an inner need and not just silly activities to pass the time.
</p>
<p>
  And then what felt like fate recommended a book by a certain Jed McKenna to me
  on Amazon, which I then read, and it was starting to talk to me directly.
  "You think you are so safe, secure and special, do you? Don't you see the
  abyss? Haven't you known about the abyss your whole life? So go ahead and keep
  ignoring it, go on adorning yourself, go ahead and gather admiration, money,
  nice things, go ahead and talk up a storm about how great you are.
</p>
<p>
  But doesn't it bore you? Aren't you tired playing a game that is so facile, so
  devoid of anything except words and perception? Don't you want to know what's
  real? Why don 't you come and find out? All you have to do is jump."
</p>

<p>
  And so I jumped. This little part of myself that had started to become a
  little sick of myself and my petty self-absorption, I started to listen to
  that part, and it expanded instantly, and became all I saw. It had been easy
  to keep at bay all my life, nothing bigger than a flea, but once expanded, it
  would have taken an act of utter violence to silence it, and there was no
  reason for me to commit that violence, and it was so much easier just to give
  in to the current.
</p>
<p>
  What happened next one might describe as closing a short circuit in my brain.
  It was at the same time being purged and doing the purging, and anyway the
  line between doing and being done to was becoming profusely thin. There were
  moments of utter horror that were devouring me from the inside, and the next
  moment I found myself safe and sound, without a scratch. The process, which is
  unusual but not without precedent, has been compared to a stomach flu, where
  moments of retching like you want to rid of your inner organs give way to
  relief, peace and exhausted gratitude in an instant. Right before the next
  wave starts to build up.
</p>
<p>
  I started to let go of social norms, because that was not my guide anymore. I
  didn't go rogue, but it wasn 't me that deterred me from extreme behavior. I
  contemplated giving up my flat, taking a walk on a bridge railing, musing
  loudly about suicide at my mother's birthday brunch, and suicide itself at
  regular intervals. It wasn't my "common sense" that saved me, but
  rather some hardwiring that I got to experience and came to tentatively rely
  on. My exterior appearance did become an acquired taste, there were signs of
  insanity hard to conceal. I was erratic, crying a lot, at times in public,
  speaking to myself, also in public, I wrote thousands of pages, on my
  computer and on my phone when I was roaming outside. I didn't work, I didn't
  know whether I was ever going to work again, whether I would be able to,
  because I was about to abolish all that mechanisms that had made me hold down
  a job. I didn't speak much to other people, and when I did I probably sounded
  either like a sage from a mountain, or a lunatic with a chainsaw.
</p>
<p>
  Although it must have looked like someone seriously losing touch, it felt like
  I was becoming in touch for the first time. Before all I had experienced had
  been myself, my narration of the world and my place in it, only losely related
  to the outside world, ever so busy maintaing my ego, which had invariably lead
  me to bump my nose and shins and whatnot every few steps.
</p>
<p>
  Now the universe seemed to be shouting at me a lot, like it was berating at me
  for having been so ignorant before. But it also turned out to be kind and
  funny and gentle, talking to me through movies and books and posters in the
  street. When I stopped trying to perform alchemy in my mind, elevating me and
  my existence into something it just was not, the world, the facts, the people
  started to acquire a certain glow in my perception. People can still bother me
  greatly, even more that before because I don't need to shield myself from the
  extent of people peopling. But I can now perceive the universe being
  unfathomably close through their actions.
</p>
<p>
  Can I absolutely know that there is some intelligence out there, one that in
  addition bothers to relate to me little chicken? No, of course not. But there
  are clues, and since I somewhat gave up on looking to other people for
  footing, a playful universe is what keeps me around.
