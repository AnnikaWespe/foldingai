  I had always thought that I could either reach financial stability, or lead my
  life with the amount of time free from depersonalized labour that I seemed to
  need to maintain my mental and physical health.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  In late summer 2020 though, I seemed to have managed exactly that; after
  working several years as a software dev freelancer in a money-flushed economy,
  I had saved up an amount of wealth that was baffling to me, and as a
  beneficiary of business politics had not had to work all that hard for it.
  Quite the contrary, I had had the opportunity for very long walks to regroup
  and stabilize myself after what had felt like a life of emotional and
  financial volatility.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  So when the project finally ended, I found myself at the end of a rope; what I
  had not dared to wish for for several decades had come to pass, and it seemed
  like I had nothing more left to chase in any important area of my life. There
  were literally no further endeavours that seemed worth pursuing — none that
  would have come from an inner desire anyway, and not just that mindless need to pass
  the time.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  And then what felt like fate recommended a book by a certain Jed McKenna to me
  on Amazon, which I then read, and I was startled when it started talking to me
  directly.
</p>

<blockquote class="paragraph">
  “You think you are so safe, secure and special, do you? Don’t you see the
  abyss? Haven’t you known about the abyss your whole life? So go ahead and keep
  ignoring it, go on adorning yourself, go ahead and gather admiration, money,
  nice things, go ahead and talk up a storm about how great you are.
  <br /><br />
  But doesn’t it bore you? Aren’t you tired of playing a game that is so facile,
  so devoid of anything except words and perception? Don’t you want to know
  what’s real? Why don’t you come and find out? All you have to do is jump.”
</blockquote>

<p class="paragraph">
  And so I jumped. This little part of myself that had started to become a
  little sick of myself and my petty self-absorption — I started to listen to
  that part, and it expanded instantly, and became all I saw. It had been easy
  to keep at bay all my life, nothing bigger than a flea, but once expanded, it
  would have taken an act of utter violence to silence it. And there was no real
  reason for me to commit that violence; it was so much easier just to give in
  to the current.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">And that’s when things started to unravel.</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  What happened next could best be described as closing a short circuit in my
  brain. I was at the same time being purged and doing the purging, and anyway
  the line between doing and being done to was becoming profusely thin. There
  were moments of utter horror that were devouring me from the inside, and the
  next moment I found myself safe and sound without a scratch. The process,
  which is unusual but not without precedent, has been compared to a stomach
  flu, where moments of retching as if you wanted to rid yourself of your inner
  organs give way to relief, peace and exhausted gratitude in an instant —
  giving you some rest before the next wave starts to build up.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  I started to let go of social norms, because that was not my guide anymore. I
  didn’t go rogue, but it wasn’t me that deterred me from extreme behavior. I
  contemplated giving up my flat, taking a walk on a bridge railing, musing
  loudly about suicide at my mother’s birthday brunch, and suicide itself at
  regular intervals. It wasn’t my “common sense” that saved me. Common Sense was
  currently indisposed, what with being chopped up and all. Rather, I got to
  repeatedly experience the saving grace in the hardwiring of my brain.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  Nonetheless, my exterior appearance did become an acquired taste: there were
  signs of insanity hard to conceal. I was erratic, crying a lot, at times in
  public, speaking to myself, also in public. I wrote thousands of pages on my
  computer, and on my phone while I was roaming outside. I didn’t work, I didn’t
  even know whether I was ever going to be able to work again, because I was
  about to abolish all those mechanisms that had made me able to hold down a
  job. I didn’t speak much to other people, and when I did I probably sounded
  either like a sage from a mountain, or a lunatic with a chainsaw.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Although it must have looked like someone seriously losing touch, it felt like
  I was getting in touch for the first time in my life. Before, all I had
  experienced had been myself, my narration of the world and my place in it,
  only loosely related to the outside world, ever so busy maintaining my ego,
  which had invariably led me to bump my nose and shins against reality every
  few steps.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Now the universe seemed to be shouting at me a lot, like it was berating me
  for having been so ignorant before. But it also turned out to be kind and
  funny and gentle, talking to me through movies, posters in the street, and
  strange coincidences. When I stopped trying to perform alchemy in my mind,
  elevating me and my existence into something it just was not, the world, the
  facts, even people started to acquire a certain glow in my perception. Don't
  get me wrong, to this day people can still bother me greatly — even more than
  before, because I don’t need to shield myself from the extent of people
  peopling. But I can now perceive the universe being unfathomably close through
  their actions.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Can I absolutely know that there is some intelligence out there, one that in
  addition bothers to relate to me little chicken? No, of course not. But there
  are clues, and since I somewhat gave up on looking to other people for safe
  footing, a playful universe is what keeps me around.
</p>
