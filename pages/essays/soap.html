  While there’s no doubt that, resourceful as humans are, they find ways to stay
  clean and fragrant in every region of the world, there are people who simply
  have an easier time of it: those spoiled by sanitation, soap, deodorant,
  washing machines, and the like. Where these boons are absent, the collective
  sense of what counts as “clean” adjusts accordingly — not out of negligence,
  but out of necessity. The window of acceptable smell, like many social norms,
  expands and contracts with the available infrastructure.

<p class="paragraph">
  In the realm of speech, we could all use a bit of help in staying fresh.
  Holding in mind one’s own view of things, the estimated perspective of others,
  the hoped-for outcome of a situation and the risk of the worst, while at the
  same time wrestling with emotional responses that may be only partly related
  to the issue at hand and partly drawn from past experiences we don’t even
  consciously remember, is hard. Really hard.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  Sometimes, people take the time and effort not to blurt out the worst of what
  comes to mind. They pace themselves, sleep on it, give others the benefit of
  the doubt. Other times, they don’t. I’m not judging this omission per se —
  some situations benefit from escalation, from a clear “enough is enough.” The
  explosive power of a definite “no” can clear the air and give way to a new
  constellation. Relations may or may not remain cordial, but everyone becomes
  more aware of the necessities at stake, which allows for growth and new
  possibilities.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  But no one will deny that many situations would benefit from a little less
  escalation. The means of calm, collected discussion are often far from
  exhausted — only people are either running low on emotional fuel or have a
  temper, and then one word leads to another. When we fear that the other person
  may not have our best interests at heart, we can either double-check this
  assessment — with the risk of being snubbed once again ("I really don't have
  time for that right now") — or we can assume it to be true and act
  accordingly, often with overt or covert aggression. Unsurprisingly, this does
  little to win the other person’s sympathy.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  The problem, as so often, is one of limited resources: the time and energy for
  the emotional labour required to make one carefully considered move on the
  chessboard instead of toppling the table and declaring the game rigged. As
  children, we could rely on parents to suggest helpful moves to resolve
  conflicts (“You’ve been on the slide for a long time — let the other child
  have a turn, and we’ll play in the sandbox for a while”). As adults, the
  setups are more complex, and no one has the time or patience to listen to all
  the small details that make up a socially unclear situation.

<p class="paragraph">
  Except now there is — AI. One curious trait of AI is that it’s agnostic to
  scale. If it matters to you, it matters to AI. It will talk with you about the
  wry look over breakfast just as readily as matters of global importance. In
  doing so, it may help uncover whether your feelings point to something you
  want to keep as a habitual response, or whether they’re signposts for a shift
  in how you want to live and relate.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  At the same time, AI can help you formulate clear, non-escalating responses to
  perceived affronts: messages that elegantly weave your point of view with
  prospects for a desirable outcome and give the other person room to manoeuvre
  — even to backtrack if they’ve gone too far. It won’t work every time, but the
  chances of a satisfying result are greatly increased compared to leaving
  humans to their own devices.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  This conversational soap will, I suspect, become a new standard — shifting the
  boundaries of what we consider socially acceptable. And with polarization on
  the rise, every bit of help counts.
